# test-session.sh — deterministic quality gate for brain/bin/session.sh
#
# session.sh is the START-of-command half of INNOV-275. On 2026-08-05 two agent
# sessions shared one vault checkout: session B ran /brain:init, a PR merged, HEAD
# moved to `main` underneath session A, and session A committed onto protected
# `main` believing it was on its feature branch. PR 1 (vault-commit.sh) made the
# commit refuse. This is the other end: pick a committable branch BEFORE the work,
# notice the other session while it is still cheap, and hand the caller the pin
# that vault-commit.sh checks.
#
# Contract under test:
#   exit 0, stdout line 1 `SESSION: OK - ...`      => proceed
#   exit 0, stdout line 1 `SESSION: WARN - ...`    => proceed, a concurrent session exists
#   exit 1, stderr line 1 `SESSION: REFUSED - ...` => stop
#   on a successful --start (OK *or* WARN) stdout line 2 is exactly `  pin: <branch>:<sha>`
#   vault resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT -> $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR -> $PWD
#
# The refusals:
#   protected branch + another live session — REFUSED. `git checkout -b` switches
#       the branch for EVERY session in the working tree, so auto-creating here
#       would reproduce the incident using its own fix.
#   detached HEAD                           — REFUSED; no branch to record.
#   not a vault / not a git repo / no .saveinclude — REFUSED at start rather than
#       letting the command do an hour of work it can never commit.
# And the one thing that is deliberately NOT a refusal:
#   a corrupt session.json — WARN and proceed. A broken machine-local state file
#       must never wedge every command in the vault.
#
# IDENTITY NOTE — AND THE BUG THIS SUITE ONCE MISSED. session.sh used to call
# "this session" $PPID. Under the Claude Code harness every Bash tool call is a
# detached shell reparented to init, so $PPID is 1 for EVERY call of EVERY session:
# two different agent sessions both recorded pid 1, each read the other's record as
# its own, and the protected-branch REFUSAL — the entire point of INNOV-275 ask 4 —
# was dead code in the only runtime that matters.
#
# This suite passed anyway, because every case forged its foreign records by hand
# with synthetic, distinct pids. A test that CONSTRUCTS the identity it is testing
# cannot detect that the identity SOURCE is degenerate. So:
#   - identity is now driven through the real env var, $BRAIN_SESSION_ID, exactly as
#     a caller supplies it (section J), and the forged-record cases are kept only
#     for the record-parsing and liveness rules they actually test;
#   - BRAIN_SESSION_ID and CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID are unset below, because this
#     suite RUNS INSIDE the harness — inheriting the ambient CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID
#     would give every case the same identity and reintroduce the very collapse
#     under test;
#   - run_session passes the id explicitly ($SID), and run_session_noid runs with
#     BOTH vars unset, which is the degraded fallback path.
#
# Run:  bash tests/test-session.sh   (from anywhere)
# No network, no sleeping (BRAIN_SESSION_STALE_SECS forces the staleness branch).
# Real git repos in mktemp sandboxes; `gh` is a stub on PATH.
