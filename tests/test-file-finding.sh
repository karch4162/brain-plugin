# test-file-finding.sh — deterministic quality gate for brain/bin/file-finding.sh
#
# INNOV-262: when a guard detects a defect it cannot self-heal, it queues an
# auto-filed tracker finding instead of failing silently. Scripts have no tracker
# credentials, so the script's whole job is the QUEUE half of queue+drain:
#
# Contract under test:
#   ALWAYS exits 0 — a bug-filing helper must never break the calling command
#   first line:  FINDING: QUEUED ...  (stdout)  or  FINDING: SKIPPED ... (stderr)
#   queue file:  <vault>/.brain/findings-queue.jsonl, one JSON object per line
#   dedup:       same class+repo+normalized evidence => ONE line, count bumped
#                (normalization strips digits — "3 vs 12" and "5 vs 12" are the
#                same recurring defect)
#   secret-free: stores only its args; never reads or embeds file contents
#   graceful:    unwritable queue dir => SKIPPED on stderr, still exit 0
#
# Run:  bash tests/test-file-finding.sh   (from anywhere)
# No network, no git, no Jira. Every case gets its own mktemp -d sandbox.
