#!/usr/bin/env bash
# test-bash32-portability.sh — shipped shell scripts must run on bash 3.2.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. macOS ships bash 3.2 as /bin/bash, and the plugin's scripts
# are executed with whatever bash the user's system provides (INNOV-284). Any
# bash-4+ construct — mapfile/readarray, associative arrays, case-conversion
# parameter expansions, &>> — is a syntax or runtime error there, and the
# failure surfaces on someone else's laptop, not in CI. This suite is a static
# gate: it greps every .sh under brain/ for the whole construct class, so a
# regression fails here first.
#
# Run:  bash tests/test-bash32-portability.sh   (from anywhere)
# No network, no vault, no interpreters beyond grep.
