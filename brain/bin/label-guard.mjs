// label-guard.mjs — the ONE owner of the community-label preservation rule.
//
// THE PROBLEM THIS SOLVES (INNOV-274)
// "Never overwrite an existing non-generic community label" was implemented
// TWICE, differently, and neither implementation knew about the other:
//
//   /brain:label  → label-communities.mjs  had the real logic: a heading regex,
//                   a GENERIC placeholder pattern, classify()'s
//                   preserved > agent > derived merge, and (INNOV-263) the
//                   .community-labels.json provenance sidecar.
//   /brain:save   → sync-graph.sh          had count_named_labels(): a bash
//                   grep pair with its own idea of what a "named" heading looks
//                   like, feeding an `incoming >= existing` comparison.
//
// Two greps and one regex encoding the same concept is a drift factory — and the
// failure mode is silent destruction of human labeling work (the documented
// repo-a incident: an existence check let a 30-named/410-generic
// rebuild clobber a fully-named 440-community mirror). This module owns the two
// concepts both callers need, so there is exactly one definition of each:
//
//   (a) WHAT COUNTS AS A NAMED LABEL   → GENERIC_LABEL, isNamedLabel,
//                                        HEADING_RE, readReportLabels,
//                                        countNamedLabels
//   (b) WHEN MAY AN INCOMING REPORT    → mayReplaceReport
//       REPLACE AN EXISTING ONE
//   (c) HAS A FROZEN REPORT'S CLUSTERING → reportIdStaleness,
//       GONE STALE (INNOV-288)             reportIdStalenessOf
//
// The invariant is identical in both places; only the TRIGGER differs.
// label-communities.mjs imports (a) for its per-id preserve decision and (b) as
// a write-time invariant (an --apply must never REDUCE a report's named count).
// sync-graph.sh shells out to the CLI below for (b) at copy time.
//
// (b) IS DELIBERATELY THE COUNT RULE, NOT THE PER-ID RULE
// label-communities' per-id rule ("this id's existing non-generic label is
// off-limits") is strictly stronger, but it is not the right rule for a wholesale
// report replacement: a legitimate repo-side relabel renames every community at
// once, and the per-id rule would refuse it forever. The pinned contract is
// `incoming >= existing` — an equal-count relabel still copies. See
// tests/test-sync-graph.sh `integration/equal-count-relabel-is-allowed`.
//
// FAIL CLOSED
// Every error path in this module ERRS TOWARD PRESERVING the existing report:
//   - existing report missing            → 0 named, replacement ALLOWED
//                                          (there is nothing to destroy)
//   - existing report present but the OS
//     will not hand us its bytes         → THROW → CLI exit 1 → caller refuses
//   - existing path is not a regular file→ THROW → CLI exit 1 → caller refuses
//   - incoming report missing            → THROW → CLI exit 1 → caller refuses
//                                          (callers must not ask about a file
//                                          they are not about to copy)
//   - anything unexpected                → THROW → CLI exit 1 → caller refuses
// The one direction that errs OPEN is "existing report absent", and only because
// allowing a copy into empty space cannot lose a label.
//
// CLI (used by sync-graph.sh; pure Node, no deps):
//   node label-guard.mjs --count <report.md>
//       → one integer line: how many communities that report NAMES. A missing
//         file prints 0 and exits 0 (it names nothing). A present-but-unreadable
//         file is an ERROR, exit 1 — see fail-closed above.
//   node label-guard.mjs --stale <report.md> <graph.json>
//       → `<missing> <total>` community ids the report names that graph.json no
//         longer has, or the literal `unknown` when nothing can be concluded.
//         ADVISORY ONLY, always exit 0 — it explains a freeze, it never gates a
//         copy. See reportIdStaleness (c) below.
//
//   node label-guard.mjs --may-replace <existing.md> <incoming.md>
//       → one line `<verdict> <existingNamed> <incomingNamed>`, verdict being
//         literally `allow` or `refuse`.
//         exit 0  = allow   (and stdout starts with `allow`)
//         exit 10 = refuse  (and stdout starts with `refuse`)
//         exit 1  = COULD NOT DECIDE. Callers MUST treat this — and any exit
//                   code or stdout shape they do not recognise — as refuse.
