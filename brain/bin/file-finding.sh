# file-finding.sh — queue a plugin defect for automatic tracker filing.
#
# When a guard detects a condition it cannot self-heal (shrink-guard/label
# refusal, unresolvable source: anchor, mis-scoped graph, label-count
# regression), it calls this script instead of failing silently — and so does
# an agent that hits a plugin bug (templates/CLAUDE.brain.md says so). Agents
# kept logging these bugs in random places; this makes the path mechanical.
#
# QUEUE + DRAIN (INNOV-262): scripts have NO tracker credentials, so this
# script never talks to a tracker. It ALWAYS writes the finding to a local queue:
#
#   <vault>/.brain/findings-queue.jsonl     (one JSON object per line)
#
# The skill layer (an agent with tracker MCP access) drains the queue to the
# tracker committed in <vault>/brain.json — see the "Drain the findings queue"
# section in skills/save/SKILL.md. Dedup is by a
# stable fingerprint: sha over defect-class + repo + NORMALIZED evidence
# (lowercased, digits stripped, whitespace collapsed — so "3 vs 12" and
# "5 vs 12" are the same recurring defect). A repeat finding bumps `count`
# on the existing queue line instead of adding a new one; the fingerprint
# doubles as the Jira label (brain-fp-<12hex>) the drain searches before
# creating a ticket.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash file-finding.sh <defect-class> <repo> <evidence...>
#
# defect-class: kebab-case, e.g. shrink-guard-refusal, unresolvable-source-anchor,
#               mis-scoped-graph, label-count-regression (free-form; those four
#               are the documented ones).
# evidence:     remaining args, joined — paths, counts, identifiers ONLY.
#               NEVER pass secrets or file contents; this script stores its
#               args verbatim and reads no files itself.
#
# Contract:
#   ALWAYS exits 0 — a bug-filing helper must never break the calling command.
#   first line:  FINDING: QUEUED ...   (stdout — tells the user a ticket is coming)
#             or FINDING: SKIPPED ...  (stderr — queue unwritable / bad args; the
#                                       calling command proceeds untouched)
