# check-gitignore.sh — does this vault's .gitignore carry every entry the
# plugin depends on? (INNOV-281, /brain:doctor check 9)
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. /brain:init only creates governance files that are MISSING —
# correctly, because they carry user content — so a vault's .gitignore is
# frozen at scaffold time. When the template gains an entry the plugin depends
# on, existing vaults never receive it. Concrete instance: the template gained
# `.brain/` in 0.2.24, but every vault scaffolded before then still shows
# machine-local session state as untracked — or worse, gets it committed and
# shared between machines, which is exactly what .brain/ exists to prevent.
#
# THE REQUIRED SET IS NOT DEFINED HERE. It is parsed from the shipped template
# (`templates/gitignore`), where each required entry is preceded by a
# `# doctor:required <why>` marker line. A second copy in this file would be
# the INNOV-274 defect — one rule, two implementations — drifting in the most
# useless direction possible: this checker would go stale exactly when a
# newly-required entry made it matter.
#
# The VAULT is resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT (this plugin's neutral contract var),
# falling back to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR then the current dir — the script lives in
# the plugin, NOT inside the vault, so it cannot derive the vault from its own
# location.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-gitignore.sh          # report only, change nothing
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-gitignore.sh --fix    # APPEND what is missing
#
# Contract (the /brain:doctor skill and its tests depend on exactly this):
#   exit 0  => the vault .gitignore carries every required entry (or --fix just made it)
#   exit 1  => INCOMPLETE — entries are missing, or there is no usable .gitignore
# The FIRST line of output always starts with "GITIGNORE: OK" (stdout) or
# "GITIGNORE: INCOMPLETE" (stderr), so a caller can branch on it without
# parsing prose.
#
# --fix ONLY APPENDS. It never overwrites, never reorders, never removes, and
# never rewrites from the template. A vault's .gitignore is a customized
# governance file — users add their own private patterns — and a template
# overwrite would silently drop them. Appending is the only safe edit, and
# each appended entry is commented with why the plugin needs it.
#
# MATCHING IS EXACT-LINE ONLY (after trimming whitespace/CR). That is gitignore
# semantics: `chats` and `chats/` are different patterns, and no clever
# equivalence here can be trusted to agree with git's.
