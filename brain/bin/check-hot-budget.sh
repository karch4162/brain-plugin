# check-hot-budget.sh — enforce the wiki/hot.md word budget MECHANICALLY.
#
# wiki/hot.md is the rolling session cache: /brain:resume reads it FIRST every
# session and /brain:save step 5c re-extracts it into the wiki concept graph on
# every save. Every word over budget is therefore a tax on every future session
# and every future save. The budget was documented as a HARD ~500 words and was
# enforced only by prose ("run wc -w after each edit and keep cutting") — it
# shipped at 709 words twice in a single session. Prose drifts; a script holds.
# So this script owns the budget: it measures, it REPORTS the number on every
# run, and it refuses when the file is over.
#
# It is deliberately dumb: one file, one `wc -w`, one verdict. It never edits
# hot.md, never commits, never touches git at all. brain/bin/freshness.mjs keeps
# its own 1.5x (~750 words) backstop for vaults nobody has saved in a while —
# that check fires far later and on purpose; this one is the gate.
#
# The VAULT is resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT (this plugin's neutral contract var),
# falling back to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR then the current dir — the script lives in
# the plugin, NOT inside the vault, so it cannot derive the vault from its own
# location.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-hot-budget.sh                    # budget 500
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> HOT_WORD_BUDGET=400 bash check-hot-budget.sh
#
#   HOT_WORD_BUDGET — word budget, default 500. Must be a non-negative integer;
#                     anything else is ignored (with a stderr note) and 500 is
#                     used, because a typo'd budget must not silently disable
#                     the gate.
#
# Contract (the /brain:save skill and its tests depend on exactly this):
#   exit 0  => at or under budget; proceed with the save.
#   exit 1  => OVER budget; do NOT proceed past step 3 until hot.md is cut down.
# The FIRST line of output always starts with "HOT-BUDGET: OK" (stdout) or
# "HOT-BUDGET: OVER" (stderr), so a caller can branch on it without parsing
# prose. BOTH verdict lines carry the actual word count, the budget and the
# overage — the number is reported whether or not anyone is over, so the trend
# is visible before it becomes a violation.
#
# Missing preconditions are never failures (same stance as check-freshness.sh):
# a vault mid-setup with no wiki/hot.md yet, a hot.md that is unreadable or not
# a regular file, or a `wc` that fails all report OK and exit 0. This is a guard
# against bloat, not a file-existence assertion — a save must not be blocked by
# a file that isn't there to be over budget.
