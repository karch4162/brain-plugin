#!/usr/bin/env bash
# session.sh — register a brain command as a SESSION, and put it on a branch it is
# allowed to commit from, BEFORE it writes its first file.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS (INNOV-275, PR 2). On 2026-08-05 two agent sessions shared one
# vault checkout. Session B ran /brain:init, a PR merged, HEAD moved to `main`
# underneath session A, and session A committed onto protected `main` believing it
# was still on its feature branch. It was not wrong about what it had done — it was
# wrong about where it was, because HEAD and the git index are GLOBAL to a
# checkout and nothing told it they had changed.
#
# PR 1 fixed the commit: vault-commit.sh refuses a protected branch and refuses a
# moved HEAD. That is the backstop, and a backstop that fires at the END of a
# command is expensive — an hour of edits discovers at commit time that it was
# never on a committable branch. PR 2 fixes the START: pick the branch up front,
# notice the other session up front, and hand the caller the pin that PR 1 checks.
#
# WHY A FILE AND NOT A VARIABLE. A skill is not a process. "Which branch am I on"
# has to survive dozens of tool calls, each its own shell, with another agent's
# tool calls interleaved between them — there is nowhere in memory for that to
# live. It has to be persisted, and it has to be persisted somewhere BOTH sessions
# can see, which is what makes concurrency detectable at all. Hence a state file
# that is READ BEFORE IT IS WRITTEN; a write-only log would detect nothing.
#
# The VAULT is resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT (this plugin's neutral contract var),
# falling back to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR then the current dir — identical to
# vault-commit.sh. The script lives in the plugin, NOT inside the vault, so it
# cannot derive the vault from its own location.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash session.sh --start <command-name>  # register + branch policy
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash session.sh --status                # report, mutate nothing
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash session.sh --end                   # deregister THIS session
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash session.sh --print-pin             # BRANCH:SHA for vault-commit.sh
#
# Contract (callers and tests depend on exactly this):
#   exit 0, stdout first line `SESSION: OK - <reason>`      => proceed
#   exit 0, stdout first line `SESSION: WARN - <reason>`    => proceed; a concurrent
#                                                              session exists (or the
#                                                              state file was unreadable)
#   exit 1, stderr first line `SESSION: REFUSED - <reason>` => the caller must stop
#
# THE PIN LINE. On a successful --start (OK *or* WARN — WARN is a success), the
# SECOND line of stdout is exactly:
#     pin: <branch>:<sha>
# The caller passes that value straight to `vault-commit.sh --pin`. That is how the
# two halves of INNOV-275 compose without vault-commit.sh learning anything about
# sessions: this script decides where the work happens, vault-commit.sh verifies
# nothing moved in between. When --start CREATES a branch, the pin names the NEW
# branch — pinning the branch you were on before the checkout would refuse your own
# first commit.
#
# WHO IS "THIS SESSION". A skill is not a process — see above — and it is not the
# process that invoked this script either. Under the Claude Code harness EVERY Bash
# tool call is a detached shell reparented to init, so $PPID is literally 1 for
# every call of every session forever. An earlier version of this script used
# $PPID; the result was that two different agent sessions both recorded pid 1, each
# read the other's record as its own, no session ever saw a concurrent session, and
# the protected-branch REFUSAL below — the entire point of INNOV-275 ask 4 — was
# dead code in the only runtime that matters. Identity is therefore EXPLICIT, never
# derived from a process:
#     SELF_ID = $BRAIN_SESSION_ID              (set by a caller or a human)
#            or $CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID        (ambient in the Claude Code harness,
#                                               stable for the whole agent session)
#            or a random token generated at --start and persisted in
#               <vault>/.brain/session.id      (the honest fallback, see below)
#
# THE FALLBACK IS DEGRADED, AND SAYS SO. With neither env var there is nothing in
# the environment that distinguishes two sessions sharing one checkout, so:
#   - Each --start MINTS A NEW id. Two --start calls that cannot be told apart are
#     assumed to be two sessions, which keeps the REFUSAL alive (fail safe) at the
#     cost of treating one session's second --start as a second session.
#   - --print-pin / --end then read the LAST id written to .brain/session.id. That
#     is LAST-STARTED-WINS, and it is NOT SOLVED: if two id-less sessions share a
#     checkout, the one that started first will get the other's pin back. Every
#     command that resolves identity this way says so in its output and prints the
#     id with an `export BRAIN_SESSION_ID=<id>` hint, which is the actual remedy.
# Degraded and loud beats silent and wrong; under the harness (or with
# BRAIN_SESSION_ID exported) none of this applies.
#
# THE STATE FILE: <vault>/.brain/session.json — a JSON array of
# {session_id, pid, host, branch, sha, started_at, command}. `session_id` is the
# ONLY identity: `pid` and `host` are recorded for a human reading the file and for
# the best-effort reap below, and are never compared to decide whose record this
# is. Machine-local, per-checkout, gitignored
# by the vault template (.brain/), and deliberately NOT in .saveinclude or
# vault-commit.sh's REQUIRED set: committing it would sync one machine's process
# table into everybody else's vault.
#   - READ BEFORE WRITE. Reading the existing array is the entire concurrency
#     mechanism; without it every session would think it was alone.
#   - PRUNED ON EVERY WRITE, so an abandoned session cannot block the vault forever
#     and the file cannot grow without bound.
#   - WRITTEN ATOMICALLY (temp file in the same directory, then mv), so a crashed
#     run cannot leave a truncated array behind.
#   - A CORRUPT FILE IS A WARNING, NOT A FAILURE. It is treated as "no live
#     sessions" and named in the WARN. A broken machine-local state file must never
#     wedge every command in the vault — that would turn a convenience into an
#     outage, and the remedy (delete one gitignored file) is not worth blocking on.
#
# LIVENESS IS THE TIMESTAMP. A session is not a process, so there is no process to
# ask. The PRIMARY and load-bearing rule is:
#     live  <=>  (now - started_at) < BRAIN_SESSION_STALE_SECS   (default 3600)
# BRAIN_SESSION_STALE_SECS is env-overridable, so tests force both branches without
# sleeping and a human can shorten it in a fast-moving vault.
#
# The pid check that remains is a best-effort REAP and nothing else: it may only
# ever turn a fresh record DEAD, never keep a stale record alive. It fires only when
# all of these hold — a pid we could actually see, on this machine, on a platform
# where the answer means something:
#     platform is not MINGW/MSYS/CYGWIN (Git Bash cannot see native Windows pids,
#         so a failing `kill -0` there proves nothing — indeed `kill -0 1` fails)
#     AND the recorded pid is numeric and is not 1 (1 is init, and it is also what
#         a $PPID-based writer recorded for everything; it identifies nothing)
#     AND the recorded host is this host (a pid from another machine names a
#         completely unrelated process here)
#     AND `kill -0 <pid>` fails.
# Everything else is "cannot tell", which resolves to LIVE while the timestamp is
# fresh, because the two mistakes are not symmetric: treating a live session as
# dead reproduces the 2026-08-05 bug, while treating a dead session as live costs
# one wait until the record goes stale.
#
# BRANCH POLICY ON --start. This is the whole point of doing it here:
#   - not on a protected branch          -> register. WARN if another session is live.
#   - on the protected/default branch, alone
#                                        -> `git checkout -b brain/<command>-<date>`
#                                           (-2, -3 ... on collision), then register.
#   - on the protected/default branch, someone else is live
#                                        -> REFUSE. `git checkout -b` switches the
#                                           branch for EVERY session sharing the
#                                           working tree, so auto-creating here
#                                           would move the other session's HEAD out
#                                           from under it — the exact 2026-08-05
#                                           incident, caused this time by the fix.
#   - detached HEAD                      -> REFUSE. There is no branch to record,
#                                           and a commit here is lost by default.
#
# WHAT THIS IS NOT. It is not a lock. It cannot stop a second session from starting
# work, and it does not try to — it makes the collision VISIBLE at the moment it
# becomes cheap to resolve, and refuses only the one action (auto-checkout) that
# would actively damage the other session.
