// anchors.mjs — THE resolver for a note's `source:` anchor. One implementation.
//
// A `source:` anchor ("store-hub/docs/x.md", "nodejs/src/a.js@abc1234") names a
// REPO plus a path inside it. Turning that into a verdict needs the vault's
// repos.json identity map, the graphify/ mirror list, the per-machine checkout
// discovery in resolve-repos.mjs, and — for pinned revisions — git itself.
//
// This logic used to live inline in freshness.mjs. It is extracted here because
// TWO callers now need the same verdict:
//
//   freshness.mjs      — the weekly review queue (is the wiki rotting?)
//   check-anchors.mjs  — the /brain:promote gate (can this note's claim be checked
//                        on THIS machine before it becomes trusted?)
//
// A second, re-derived copy of this resolution is exactly the defect class this
// module exists to prevent: two answers to "does this anchor resolve?" is worse
// than none, because the disagreement is invisible. Import it; never fork it.
//
// THE THREE STATES ARE THE WHOLE POINT
//   verified     — the repo resolved locally and the file (or the file at the
//                  pinned rev) is there.
//   broken       — the repo resolved locally and the file is genuinely gone.
//                  This is rot: the note points at something that moved.
//   unresolvable — we could not check, either way. No local checkout, an
//                  unrecognized repo prefix, a pinned rev this clone never
//                  fetched, or an off-machine anchor (a PR/URL). Absence of a
//                  local checkout is evidence of NOTHING; reporting it as rot
//                  makes an engineer re-anchor notes that were already correct.
//
// Plus two non-verdicts that must not be silently swallowed:
//   mismatch     — the anchor resolves into a repo with a DIFFERENT remote than
//                  the note's own wiki area. The dangerous direction is a FALSE
//                  GREEN, so the file is deliberately not checked either way.
//   untracked    — the note asserts `source_untracked: true`: absence is the
//                  documented fact, so checking it would be wrong.
//
// Pure Node, no deps. Read-only: nothing here writes, commits, or fetches.
