#!/usr/bin/env bash
# sync-graph.sh — publish a repo's graphify artifacts into a brain vault.
#
# Copies the three durable artifacts (graph.json, GRAPH_REPORT.md, manifest.json)
# from <repo>/graphify-out/ into <vault>/graphify/<repo-name>/, regenerates the
# Obsidian community stub notes (communities/), appends a wiki/log.md entry, and
# commits. Push is left to you.
#
# The VAULT is resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT (this plugin's neutral contract var),
# falling back to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR then the current dir — the script lives in the
# plugin, NOT inside the vault, so it cannot derive the vault from its own location.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash sync-graph.sh                  # sync only mirrors that are STALE (see below)
#   bash sync-graph.sh <repo-path> [...]                   # sync specific repo checkout(s)
#   bash sync-graph.sh --all                               # sync EVERY mirror under <vault>/graphify/
#   bash sync-graph.sh --no-commit [...]                   # copy + log only, no git commit
#   bash sync-graph.sh --force-commit [...]                # commit even if the vault branch has an open PR
#                                                          # (NOT the protected branch — see COMMITTING below)
#
# Flags may appear in any order, anywhere before the repo args. If both
# --no-commit and --force-commit are given, --no-commit wins.
#
# DEFAULT SCOPE (no repo args): each folder name under <vault>/graphify/ is
# resolved to a checkout via the vault's repos.json/repos.local.json alias map,
# falling back to $REPOS_DIR/<name> (default: the vault's parent dir) when the
# vault has no map or the name is not in it. The alias map is what lets a mirror
# live somewhere other than a same-named directory one level down — `store-hub`
# is the repo cloned as `edge/`, `KDS` is a directory inside the monorepo clone.
# Explicit args may be a checkout path OR a bare mirror name.
# Only mirrors that are actually STALE are selected — i.e. the repo-side
# graphify-out/graph.json exists AND differs byte-for-byte from the mirrored
# copy in the vault. Mirrors nobody rebuilt this session are left alone (an
# unscoped run once degraded an untouched mirror's labels). The selected list is
# printed to stderr before any work happens; if nothing is stale the script says
# so and exits 0. Explicit repo args are NEVER filtered — naming a repo means it.
# --all opts back into the old "every mirror under graphify/" scope, skipping the
# staleness filter (it still prints the selected list to stderr).
#
# LABEL GUARD: the vault-side GRAPH_REPORT.md is only overwritten when the
# incoming report names at least as many communities as the existing one. That
# rule (and the definition of "named") lives in bin/label-guard.mjs, shared with
# /brain:label's label-communities.mjs — see INNOV-274. It is enforced by running
# `node bin/label-guard.mjs --may-replace`, and it FAILS CLOSED: if node is
# missing, the module is broken, or the answer is anything we do not recognise,
# the existing report is KEPT and the sync says so on stderr. graph.json and
# manifest.json still mirror. A freeze is never permanent-and-silent (INNOV-288):
# consecutive refusals are counted in <vault>/.brain/ and the message escalates,
# and once the frozen report's community ids no longer match the mirrored
# graph.json the sync says the report describes an obsolete clustering and names
# the remedy. It still never auto-overwrites — the decision stays human.
#
# SCOPE AUDIT (INNOV-267/268): before a mirror is published, its graph is checked
# against the standard scope by bin/scope-audit.mjs, in BOTH directions — nodes
# built from files that must be OUT (build/config manifests, test scaffolding,
# deps, generated output), and source-bearing top-level directories with ZERO
# nodes. A finding REFUSES that mirror's copy, names the offending files and the
# remedy, and makes the run exit 1; other mirrors still sync and still commit.
# The rule the audit enforces is the one the vault records, so it is finally a
# mechanism rather than a paragraph — everything enforced by prose drifts.
#
# COMMITTING IS NOT THIS SCRIPT'S JOB (INNOV-275). Every guard that used to live
# here — open-PR, protected branch, HEAD pin — now lives in bin/vault-commit.sh,
# the single commit path shared with /brain:save. This script captures the HEAD
# pin at start, copies files, and hands the commit over. It carries no commit
# rules of its own, so it cannot drift from the ones /brain:save enforces.
#
# What that buys, and what it costs, in one line each:
#   • the commit is refused on the protected/default branch, with NO override —
#     --force-commit used to bypass that here, and INNOV-275 retires it. A human
#     who genuinely means to commit onto main can run git by hand.
#   • --force-commit still overrides the OPEN-PR guard only.
#   • a refusal now leaves NOTHING staged (it used to leave the sync staged).
#     The index is shared by every session in the checkout, so leaving a payload
#     in it hands the next session a commit it never chose. Re-run instead.
#   • the sync's file copies, log.md line and stub regeneration all still happen;
#     only the commit is withheld.
#
# HEAD PIN: the vault's branch + commit SHA are recorded at start and passed to
# vault-commit.sh, which re-checks them immediately before committing. If either
# moved (a concurrent session merged a PR and moved HEAD mid-run), the commit is
# refused. --force-commit does NOT override that one.
#
# Override per machine: REPOS_DIR=~/code BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash sync-graph.sh

# --- the alias map: mirror name → checkout, from repos.json -------------------
#
# `$REPOS_DIR/<mirror-name>` assumes every covered repo is a directory sitting
# directly under one shared parent, with a folder name equal to its mirror name.
# Neither half holds:
#
#   store-hub  is the repo vendsy/edge, cloned as `edge/`      — name ≠ folder
#   KDS        is monorepo/android/applications/KDS            — not a direct child
#   hub-*      are hub/frontend, hub/services/core-service, …  — both at once
#
# tray-brain's `store-hub` mirror has been unsyncable for exactly this reason:
# the mirror exists, `$REPOS_DIR/store-hub` does not, so the flat lookup finds
# no source graph and silently skips it. A mirror that can never sync looks
# identical to a mirror nobody rebuilt.
#
# repos.json (identity: name → remote + subPath) and repos.local.json (this
# machine's absolute paths) already solve this for the anchor/freshness path.
# This just teaches the sync to read the same map. REPOS_DIR stays as the
# fallback and the discovery hint, so a vault with no repos.json behaves exactly
# as before — that is the compatibility contract, and the test suite pins it.
# Parallel indexed arrays instead of an associative array so macOS system
# bash (3.2) can run this (INNOV-284). NAMES[i] maps to PATHS[i].

# THE LABEL RULE LIVES IN bin/label-guard.mjs (INNOV-274).

# This script used to carry count_named_labels(): a pair of greps encoding its

# comparison. label-communities.mjs encoded the SAME concept a second time, in a
# regex, and neither knew about the other. Both now call one module, so the two
# commands that touch community labels (/brain:save here, /brain:label there)
# cannot drift apart.
LABEL_GUARD="$SCRIPT_DIR/label-guard.mjs"

# Asks the shared module whether the incoming report ($2) may overwrite the
# existing one ($1). Prints ONE line to stdout for the caller to parse:
#
#   allow <existing_named> <incoming_named>   → copying is safe
#   refuse <existing_named> <incoming_named>  → copying would destroy labels

# --- FREEZE VISIBILITY (INNOV-288) ------------------------------------------
#
# The label guard above is correct in isolation and has no reconciliation path
# and no expiry: once it starts refusing it refuses forever, with the same
# one-line message every time. Measured in personal-brain, a report sat frozen
# from 2026-08-12 to 2026-08-19 across 7 graph.json syncs, ending with 285 of
# 470 headings naming community ids graph.json no longer had — and the user saw
# no warning in that window, because "refused again" looks exactly like
# "refused once".
#
# So the refusal STAYS (the human decision to relabel or discard is not ours to
# make), but it becomes visible and escalating:
#   - a consecutive-refusal counter per mirror, machine-local under <vault>/.brain/
#     beside session.json and hot.pin, reset by any successful report copy;
#   - once the frozen report's community ids demonstrably no longer match the
#     graph.json we just mirrored, an explicit statement that the report now
#     describes an OBSOLETE CLUSTERING, plus the concrete remedy.
# Both are advisory text only. Every write is best-effort and every parse is
# validated: a broken counter must never abort a sync under `set -e`, and must
# never change the copy verdict — `--may-replace` remains the only gate.

# --- THE SCOPE GATE (INNOV-267 + INNOV-268) ---------------------------------
#
# The vault records a SCOPE per repo but nothing implemented it. graphify scans
# ONE positional root, so a multi-root scope is really "scan the root, carve back
# with .graphifyignore" — and that carve-out used to be git-excluded, so it
# existed only on the machine that built the graph. The mirrors that audited
# clean did so because their authors' unreviewable ignore files happened to be
# complete. bin/scope-audit.mjs is the mechanism that check was standing in for.
#
# WHY THIS GUARD'S POLARITY IS THE OPPOSITE OF THE LABEL GUARD'S, three lines up.
# The label guard FAILS CLOSED — "cannot tell" means "do not copy" — because an
# overwritten labeled report is UNRECOVERABLE: the human naming work is simply
# gone. An unaudited publish is not like that. It is recoverable (re-audit and
# re-sync at any time), it is the status quo every existing mirror was built
# under, and refusing every mirror whose graph predates this check would break
# working vaults to enforce a rule they have never been given the chance to meet.
# So:
#   OUT-OF-SCOPE / MISSING-ROOTS  → REFUSE this mirror. The audit positively
#                                   established that the graph is wrong.
#   SKIPPED / unparsable verdict  → LOUD WARNING, publish proceeds. The audit
#                                   established nothing, and says so.
# What is NOT negotiable either way is the naming: SKIPPED is never printed or
# treated as OK (INNOV-277/279). "We could not check" and "we checked and it is
# fine" are different sentences, and a run that conflates them tells the reader
# to stop looking.
SCOPE_AUDIT="$SCRIPT_DIR/scope-audit.mjs"

# Runs the audit for one mirror. Sets SCOPE_VERDICT (OK | OUT-OF-SCOPE |
# MISSING-ROOTS | SKIPPED | UNKNOWN) and SCOPE_OUTPUT (the full report).
# UNKNOWN covers every way the answer can be uninterpretable — node missing, the
# module gone, a first line we do not recognise, or a first line whose verdict
# disagrees with the exit status. It is deliberately NOT collapsed into SKIPPED:
# SKIPPED is the auditor's own honest "I could not determine this", UNKNOWN is
# "the auditor did not answer at all", and the stderr text differs accordingly.

  # one. This is a COMPARISON, not an existence check: a keyless repo-side rebuild
  # can emit a handful of named headings alongside hundreds of "Community N"
  # placeholders, and copying that over a fully named report destroys the
  # vault-side labels and breaks every Code: [[_COMMUNITY_*]] link built on them
  # (the documented tray_pos_flutter incident). So we copy only when the incoming
  # report names at least as many communities as the existing one — an equal count
  # (a same-count relabel or plain content refresh) still copies. graph.json syncs
  # below either way; stubs regenerate from the preserved report + new graph
  # (member-overlap matching keeps stub filenames stable).
  #
  # The rule itself is label-guard.mjs's (shared with /brain:label). That makes
  # this guard depend on `node` BEFORE the copy, whereas build-community-notes.mjs
  # (also node) only runs after — so a missing node now surfaces earlier. That is
  # deliberate and consistent with the guard's whole purpose: the two failures are
  # not symmetric. Stubs not regenerating is recoverable (re-run the sync); a
  # report overwritten because we could not check it is not. So a node/module
  # failure REFUSES the report copy, exactly as an explicit refusal does, and only
  # the report — graph.json and manifest.json still mirror, and the vault keeps
  # the report it already had.

# --- commit, via THE one guarded commit path (INNOV-275) --------------------
# Everything this block used to do by hand — open-PR detection, default-branch
# detection, the protected-branch refusal, the HEAD-pin re-check, the staging —
# now lives in vault-commit.sh, because /brain:save needed all of it too and a
# second copy would drift. This script's remaining job is to say WHAT to commit
# (the two paths it wrote) and WHEN it started (the pin).
#
# The paths must be covered by the vault's .saveinclude or vault-commit.sh will
# refuse — deliberately. "The sync may commit graph mirrors" is a statement about
# what the vault permits, so it belongs in the vault's allowlist, not hardcoded
# in the syncer. The shipped template lists both.
# --- a save is ONE commit: never self-commit under a live session (SPO-324) ---
# This is NOT a commit-safety rule, and must not be relocated into
# vault-commit.sh. INNOV-275 moved the safety guards (open-PR, protected branch,
# HEAD-pin re-check) there and they stay there: vault-commit.sh owns "is this
# commit safe". This block is the caller answering "do I want one at all" —
# exactly what --no-commit has always been. We default that flag from observable
# state instead of trusting a step in skills/save/SKILL.md to remember it.
#
# Why prose was not enough: /brain:save step 5 runs this script and is documented
# (SKILL.md, step 5) to pass --no-commit, because graphify/ is on .saveinclude
# and step 6's single vault-commit.sh carries the mirrors — one commit per save,
# pin valid end to end. An agent running an older or different SKILL.md drops the
# flag; this script then commits, HEAD moves past the session's recorded pin, and
# step 6 refuses every save in which a covered repo's source changed. That is not
# hypothetical: sessions on brain 0.2.33 did it on 2026-08-18 and 2026-08-19,
# days after the flag fix shipped in 0.2.34 (Linear SPO-324). Everything enforced
# by prose drifts; this now cannot.
#
# ANY live session suppresses the commit, not merely another agent's — the pin
# that would be stranded is usually THIS session's own. With no live record a
# standalone sync still commits for itself, exactly as documented above.
