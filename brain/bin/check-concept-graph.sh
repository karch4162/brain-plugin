# check-concept-graph.sh — surface TOTAL wiki concept-graph staleness (INNOV-286).
#
# /brain:save step 5c gates the wiki concept-graph refresh on notes changed THIS
# session (changed-wiki-notes.sh). Staleness accumulated across prior sessions is
# invisible to that gate: a recorded incident had 2 session-changed notes while
# the concept graph was 517 documents behind — and the step reported green. Same
# false-green class as INNOV-279. This script measures the TOTAL: every wiki note
# added/modified since the graph was last built, whichever session did it.
#
# "Last built" is approximated as the last commit that touched the vault's own
# graphify-out/graph.json — an uncommitted rebuild can therefore over-report
# until step 6 commits it, which WARN polarity makes harmless. The changed-note
# set is computed by changed-wiki-notes.sh --since <that commit> (uncommitted +
# committed-since, added/modified only). It is NEVER computed from graphify-out
# manifest.json — INNOV-271 documents that list over-reporting hundreds of notes
# when ten changed.
#
# WARN polarity, deliberately: exit 1 makes the staleness VISIBLE, it never
# blocks anything. Deliberately skipping the rebuild stays allowed; the point is
# that the skip line carries the number.
#
# The VAULT is resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT (this plugin's neutral contract var),
# falling back to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR then the current dir — the script lives in
# the plugin, NOT inside the vault, so it cannot derive the vault from its own
# location.
#
# Usage:
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> bash check-concept-graph.sh                       # threshold 25
#   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> CONCEPT_GRAPH_THRESHOLD=5 bash check-concept-graph.sh
#
#   CONCEPT_GRAPH_THRESHOLD — WARN when the count EXCEEDS this, default 25.
#                             Must be a non-negative integer; anything else is
#                             ignored (with a stderr note) and 25 is used, so a
#                             typo'd threshold cannot silently disable the gate.
#
# Contract (the /brain:save and /brain:doctor skills and the tests depend on it):
#   exit 0  => first line "CONCEPT-GRAPH: OK"      (stdout) — at/under threshold,
#           or first line "CONCEPT-GRAPH: SKIPPED" (stdout) — not measurable:
#              no graphify-out/graph.json, not a git repo, or graph.json exists
#              but has never been committed (no last-built point to diff from —
#              said outright rather than guessed at).
#   exit 1  => first line "CONCEPT-GRAPH: STALE - N document(s) behind" (stderr).
#              WARN only: the caller relays the line; nothing is blocked.
# Both OK and STALE carry the count and the threshold, so the trend is visible
# before it becomes a violation (same stance as check-hot-budget.sh).
