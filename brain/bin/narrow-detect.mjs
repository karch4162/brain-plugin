// narrow-detect.mjs — make graphify's incremental re-extract the notes GIT says
// changed, not the ones the filesystem's mtimes claim (INNOV-303).
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. /brain:save step 5c refreshes the wiki concept graph by
// invoking the graphify skill with `wiki --update`. That is a bare FOLDER, so
// graphify's `detect_incremental` re-derives the changed set itself — from
// mtimes. A branch switch, a merge or a fresh clone rewrites mtimes across the
// whole corpus without changing a single byte of content, and the "incremental"
// then re-extracts everything. Measured on a real vault 2026-09-22:
//
//     detect_incremental on wiki/   ->  630 of 632 notes "changed"
//     changed-wiki-notes.sh (git)   ->    2  (wiki/hot.md, wiki/log.md)
//
// 5c dispatches one subagent per changed note, so that is a full corpus rebuild
// wearing an incremental's clothing — the concrete mechanism behind "5c burns
// 30-60% of a session". save/SKILL.md already says the git list is authoritative
// and that the manifest must never drive re-extraction; the handoff to graphify
// was simply throwing that list away. graphify is third-party (no local source),
// so the fix is brain-side: run this between graphify's detect step and its
// Step 3A, and the git list is what actually reaches the extractor.
//
// It rewrites ONLY `files` (the changed subset that drives Step 3A's AST pass and
// Step 3B0's cache check / subagent dispatch) and `total_files`. `all_files` —
// the full corpus other steps need for context — is left exactly as graphify
// wrote it, as is the manifest graphify saves at the end of the update, which
// records the whole corpus and so still heals the mtime skew by itself.
//
// IT REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES. Narrowing on a measurement we could not take
// would silently skip a legitimate re-extraction — the same false-green class
// this workstream keeps finding. So every case where the git list cannot be
// TRUSTED (not a git repo, graph.json never committed, the sibling script
// missing or failing, or a list that matches nothing in the detect file) leaves
// the detect file untouched and says SKIPPED with the reason.
//
// The VAULT is resolved from $BRAIN_ROOT (this plugin's neutral contract var),
// falling back to $CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR then the current dir — the script lives in
// the plugin, NOT inside the vault, so it cannot derive the vault from its own
// location.
//
// Usage:
//   BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> node narrow-detect.mjs                  # narrow in place
//   node narrow-detect.mjs --vault <path>
//   node narrow-detect.mjs --detect <path/to/.graphify_detect.json>
//   node narrow-detect.mjs --dry-run                           # report, write nothing
//
// Contract (save/SKILL.md step 5c and tests/narrow-detect.test.mjs depend on it):
//   exit 0 => first line "DETECT-NARROW: OK - narrowed N -> M file(s) ..."
//             the detect file now lists exactly the git-changed notes.
//   exit 0 => first line "DETECT-NARROW: SKIPPED - <reason>"
//             nothing was written; graphify's own list stands. Never silent.
//   exit 2 => usage error or the detect file is unreadable/not JSON.
