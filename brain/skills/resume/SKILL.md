# /brain:resume — load brain session context

## Portable hosts and URL-backed vaults

In Codex, Grok Build, Grok Bot, or a project using a .brain/config.json binding, read [the shared workflow](../../references/portable.md) first and use its matching command flow. It supplies neutral configuration, isolated sessions, and host-specific adaptations. For legacy Claude projects, the workflow below remains supported.


Run at the **start** of a working session in a brain vault to rehydrate context the way `/brain:save` left it. This is the read half of the session-continuity loop; [[save]] is the write half.

Resolve the vault root as `$BRAIN_ROOT` (else the current project dir / cwd); all paths below are relative to it.

## What to do when invoked

Do these in order; keep the summary tight (the user wants to start working, not read a report).

1. **Check whether another session is already live in this checkout.** `/brain:resume` is read-only, so it uses **`--status` only — never `--start`, never `--end`.** `--start` would create a branch, and creating a branch is a write; resume must never do that.
   ```bash
   bash "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/session.sh" --status   # from the vault root, or with BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> set
   ```
   - **Exit `0`, first line `SESSION: OK` →** no other session is live. Print nothing about it and go on to step 2.
   - **Exit `0`, first line `SESSION: WARN` →** **another session is live against this vault.** Relay the script's `SESSION: WARN` line to the user **verbatim** — it names the other session's branch and pid; do not paraphrase or re-derive it — and put it on the `Session:` line of the output block. Like `In flight:`, this is context, not a gate: it means `HEAD` and the git index may move underneath you, so expect the write-side commands to refuse.
   - **Exit `1`, first line `SESSION: REFUSED` →** relay the script's `SESSION: REFUSED` line to the user **verbatim** and **do not work around it with a raw `git checkout` / `git switch`.** Resume changes nothing either way, so report it and stop rather than "fixing" the branch to get further.

2. **Sync refs and see what's in flight.** Before reading anything, `git fetch --prune` (safe here — it touches refs, not the working tree), then list open PRs:
   ```bash
   git fetch --prune
   gh pr list --json number,title,author,headRefName --jq '.[] | "#\(.number) \(.title) — \(.author.login)"'
   ```
   A current `main` does **not** mean the vault is uncontested: a PR opened minutes ago can be rewriting the very note you're about to touch. Report them in the `In flight:` line below. If `gh` is missing, unauthed, or offline, say so in one line and carry on — this is context, not a gate.

3. **Resolve the briefing ref, then read the hot cache from it.** Steps 3–5 read from `origin/<default>`, **never the working tree** — `/brain:save` leaves the checkout on its save branch, so the tree is routinely days behind and its `hot.md` describes loops that were closed since. Always read through the helper; do not hand-run `git show ref:path` (Git Bash mangles it and reports existing files as missing):
   ```bash
   B="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/resume-brief.sh"   # from the vault root, or with BRAIN_ROOT=<vault> set
   bash "$B"                       # BRIEF: origin/<default>   [+ DRIFT: ... when the checkout is behind]
   bash "$B" --cat wiki/hot.md
   ```
   Put the `BRIEF:` line on the `Briefed from:` output line and any `DRIFT:` line on `Drift:`, both **verbatim**. Drift is context, not a gate: **do not `git switch` / `git pull` to fix it** — resume never moves the tree, and `/brain:save` step 0b brings the branch current (and repins its session) when the vault is about to be written. `BRIEF: worktree - ...` means no remote ref was reachable; the helper falls back to the checkout, and the output must say so rather than claim to be current.

   `wiki/hot.md` is the ~500-word rolling summary of current focus, graph entry vocabulary, and active gotchas. This is the single highest-signal file.

4. **Read the 3 most recent session logs.** `bash "$B" --logs` prints the newest 3 `logs/YYYY-MM-DD-*.md` paths; read each with `bash "$B" --cat <path>`. Pull out: decisions made, and anything under a "Pending / next steps" heading that is still open.

5. **Pull relevant wiki notes.** Based on what the user says they're about to work on (or, if they said nothing, the focus in `hot.md`), again via `bash "$B" --cat <path>`:
   - Skim `wiki/index.md` for the area's notes.
   - Read the specific notes that match the task. Honor the [[3-step query rule]]: if the task is structural, also note which `graphify/<repo>/graph.json` mirror to query.

6. **Surface open loops.** If any recent log has unresolved "Open decision" / "NEXT" items, list them — these are the things most likely to have been forgotten between sessions.

## Output format

Keep it to ~10 lines:

```
Resumed. Last session: <date> — <one-line what happened>.
Briefed from: <the helper's BRIEF: line, verbatim>
Drift: <the helper's DRIFT: line, verbatim>   ← omit the line entirely when there is none
Focus: <from hot.md>.
Session: <the script's SESSION: WARN line, verbatim>   ← omit the line entirely on SESSION: OK
In flight: #<n> <title> (<author>)      ← omit the line entirely if no PRs are open
Open loops:
  - <pending item> (from <log>)
  - <pending item>
Relevant notes for "<this task>": [[note]], [[note]]; graph mirror: graphify/<repo>/graph.json
```

Then ask what they want to tackle, or proceed if they already said.

## Notes

- Read-only. `/brain:resume` never writes — it only loads context (`git fetch` updates refs but never the working tree, and the briefing is read from `origin/<default>` with `git show`, so a stale checkout is reported rather than switched or pulled). That is why step 1 uses `session.sh --status` and **never `--start` or `--end`**: `--start` creates a branch on the default branch (a write), and `--end` would clear a record resume never opened, silencing a warning some *other* live session is owed. The mirror of this is [[save]].
- **`In flight:` is context, not a gate.** Never tell the user to merge someone else's PR before they can work — it may be a draft, under review, or not theirs. The write-side commands ([[promote]], [[tidy]]) do the file-level collision check that actually blocks.
- If `logs/` has fewer than 3 entries, read what exists.
- Don't dump full file contents into the chat; synthesize.
