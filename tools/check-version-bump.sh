# check-version-bump.sh — fail if a plugin dir (brain/, wave/, ...) changed but its version did not.
#
# A feature branch satisfies the gate by ADDING a bump fragment,
# .bumps/<dir>/<name> (content patch|minor|major, empty = patch);
# tools/bump-version.mjs turns fragments into one version at release time.
# Editing the version literal on every branch made each pair of parallel PRs
# conflict (INNOV-311), so a direct bump is now only the release PR's job.
#
# Usage: check-version-bump.sh [base-ref]   (default: origin/main)
#
# Compares HEAD against the merge-base with <base-ref>, mirroring what
# `git diff base...HEAD` shows on a PR. Must run on bash 3.2 (macOS) —
# no mapfile, no associative arrays (INNOV-284).
