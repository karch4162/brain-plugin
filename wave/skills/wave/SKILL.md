name: wave
description: Start a wave of unsupervised Orca workers on agent-ready tracker issues (Linear or Jira, configured per repo), and run the fresh-session checklist around it (leftovers, brain save, worktree sweep, queue check). Use when the user says "/wave", "spin up N workers", "start a wave", "run the loop", or opens a session wanting agents working the backlog.

# /wave — run a wave of Orca workers

Each worker takes one issue in its own Orca worktree, ships a PR, and writes a summary
into its worktree comment. A successor wave is opt-in (`AUTO_SUCCESSOR=1`), not
automatic; the human reviews between ordinary waves.

The scripts live next to this file. Every command below uses
```bash
WAVE="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/wave"
```
and runs from inside the target repo. `spawn.sh` holds the worker prompt — the contract,
edited there and never per-spawn. `review.sh` is the pre-PR Codex Terra review with an
optional Grok risk review; `tiebreak.sh` the Astra-only escalation; `triage.sh` the
step-4 labelling pre-grep; `status.sh` steps 1 and 3; `cost.sh` per-ticket token split.
`DRY_RUN=1 bash "$WAVE/spawn.sh" <ISSUE>` prints the prompt without spawning.

## Per-repo config

A repo opts in with two committed files:
- **`.claude/wave/config.env`** (required) — tracker (`linear`|`jira`), the agent-ready
  queue query, workflow state names, where follow-ups get filed. Start from
  `$WAVE/config.example.env`. Every script refuses to run without it.
- **`.claude/wave/notes.md`** (optional) — project rules appended to the worker prompt
  verbatim: shared databases, dev-server ports, env files to copy, current CI state.
  This is the only place project knowledge goes. Keep it current: a stale line
  there (e.g. "ignore red CI, billing is blocked" after billing is fixed) tells
  workers to ignore real failures, which is worse than no line.

The base ref comes from `origin/HEAD` (override with `WAVE_BASE`); the Orca repo is
matched by the main checkout's path.

Tracker access: Linear goes through `orca linear`; Jira through the Atlassian MCP,
which has no shell CLI — so for Jira the host session does the queue query and
`triage.sh` reads issues from saved JSON.

## Fresh session checklist

Run these in order. Steps 1–3 clear yesterday; 4 is the only one needing judgment.

**1. See what's left over.** `bash "$WAVE/status.sh"`
Anything `in-review` with an open PR still needs your review. Anything `in-progress`
with no PR either died or is still working — check its terminal before assuming.

**2. Batch the summaries into one `/brain:save`.** Read the full comments
(`orca worktree ps --json`), then run `/brain:save` **once** for the whole batch.
Never per worktree: `wiki/hot.md` is a single ≤500-word rolling cache, and three
near-duplicate entries crowd out everything else. Workers deliberately do not save.

Worktree comments are not the whole batch: PRs from people or agents outside Orca have
only a PR body. List every merge since the last save and read those bodies too:
```bash
git log --merges --format='%s' <last-save-sha>..HEAD | grep -o '#[0-9]*' | tr -d '#' | xargs -I{} gh pr view {} --json number,title,body
```

Lines to look for, all from the pre-PR review (`spawn.sh` step 4.5):
`REVIEWER: codex-terra` confirms the required correctness review;
`ARCHITECTURE REVIEWER: grok` means a named risk trigger called for an adversarial
review; `TIE-BREAKER: astra` means those two reviews directly conflicted.
`REVIEWER DISMISSED:` is a finding the worker judged wrong — check whether it was.
Any `NO ... REVIEW:` marker blocks the PR and needs human review; it is not a reason to
try another provider. `REVIEWER: grok-fallback` or `sonnet-fallback (codex quota
exhausted)` means the gate ran on a weaker reviewer, so read that diff yourself.

**3. Sweep merged worktrees.** `bash "$WAVE/status.sh" --sweep` prints the commands;
read them, then pipe to `bash`. A worktree comment dies with its worktree — Orca keeps
no archive — so capture it for step 2 *before* sweeping. The PR body outlives it.
To free memory without losing a summary, stop the agent instead:
`orca terminal stop --worktree name:<slug>` keeps checkout, comment, and status.

**3.5 Verify the merged batch (only if the repo has a runtime surface).** This is the
only window where nothing else runs, so this session may own shared state. Walk
exactly what the summaries name (`NOT VERIFIED IN BROWSER: <route>`, anything needing a
write or a multi-step flow) — no exploratory clicking. Never against production; the
repo's `notes.md` says what is safe. Output is tracker issues filed to `WAVE_FILE_TO`,
never fixes: the PRs are merged. Time-box ~15 min and report "walked N, M findings" —
an empty report means it did not run. Repos with no UI (plugins, libraries) skip this.

**4. Check the queue — the only step that needs you.** Run the config's `WAVE_QUEUE`
against the tracker (Linear: `orca linear`; Jira: the Atlassian MCP JQL search).
Choose the exact wave size before spawning. If the queue is thin, label first — see the
criteria below — starting with the pre-grep, which does the mechanical half:
```bash
bash "$WAVE/triage.sh" SPO-378                 # linear: selected candidates
bash "$WAVE/triage.sh" --all                   # linear: intentional full-backlog pass
bash "$WAVE/triage.sh" --json candidates.json  # jira: save the MCP search result first
```
For each issue it resolves every `file:line` the body cites against the base ref,
hands the ticket plus live excerpts to a cheap headless model (`TRIAGER=grok` default,
`agy`, `sonnet`), and prints `HOLDS`/`STALE`/`UNCLEAR` with the deciding line. The
verdict is a hint; the label is still yours. An issue citing no `file:line` is listed
but not judged, because that trait is what predicts a safe unsupervised run.

**5. Spawn the wave**, one issue per worker:
```bash
bash "$WAVE/spawn.sh" INNOV-309
bash "$WAVE/spawn.sh" INNOV-301
```
Pick issues that touch **different areas** — two workers in the same files produce
conflicting PRs. Three is a comfortable width on one machine; the ceiling is usually
concurrent builds, not agents.

## What makes an issue `agent-ready`

The label is a human gate. Workers must never apply it, including to follow-ups they
file themselves (the prompt forbids it).

**Yes:** a reproducible defect or bounded change that names its own `file:line` or a
reference implementation to copy. That trait predicts a safe unsupervised run far
better than size does.

**No:**
- needs a write to shared state every worker sees (a shared dev DB, a migration) —
  one reset corrupts a sibling mid-run
- research, pricing, legal, or product-direction judgment
- large or mixed-scope diffs ("consolidate X and Y", "rename across 32 files")
- anything the repo's `notes.md` names as hand-maintained

## Things that bit us, so they live in the prompt

- **The claim lock is the Orca worktree, not the tracker assignee.** Every worker runs
  as the same user, so "confirm I'm the assignee" cannot tell self from sibling — two
  successors once both claimed one issue and shipped duplicate PRs. `spawn.sh` refuses
  an issue that already has a worktree in this repo.
- **`gate-loop` only on escalation** — after `/preflight` fails twice on the same
  command. Generators for a one-line diff are waste, and they overwrite test files.
- **Workers never clean up their own worktree**, even when told the PR merged.
- **Gitignored files the build needs** (`.env.local` and the like): copy them in
  Orca's setup hook, and say so in `notes.md`, so agents stop improvising them.

## What Orca already remembers

Repo registration, the setup hook, and every worktree with its comment and status until
you remove it. `BRAIN_ROOT` in global Claude settings lets any worktree's agent find the
vault. None of the protocol above is stored by Orca — that is why it lives here.
